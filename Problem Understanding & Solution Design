Problem Understanding & Solution Design
1. Problem Understanding

The goal of the project is to create a secure and reliable Password Generator system that can generate strong passwords based on user requirements and optionally store them in a database. The main problem is that users often create weak, predictable passwords, which increases security risks.
To solve this, the system must:

Generate strong, random passwords

Allow users to select password length

Include options like uppercase letters, lowercase letters, digits, and special symbols

Store generated passwords safely (optional database feature)

Provide a simple, user-friendly interface

Understanding this problem helps ensure the system meets both security needs and user convenience.



2. Solution Design

To solve the problem effectively, a structured system design is created that defines how each part of the application will work together.

a) Modular Structure

The project is divided into separate classes such as:

PasswordGenerator – handles password logic

UserInputHandler – takes input from the user

PasswordService/DAO – stores passwords in database

DBHelper – manages database connectivity

This keeps the project clean and easy to maintain.


b) Algorithm Design

A secure password generation algorithm is designed using:

Random character selection

Combination of multiple character sets

Dynamic length based on user choice

This ensures every password generated is strong and unpredictable.

c) OOP-Based Architecture

Object-Oriented concepts are used for a proper structure:

Encapsulation for hiding internal logic

Inheritance for reusability

Polymorphism where needed (like different generation strategies)

Exception Handling for error-free execution



d) Data Flow Design

User enters password preferences

Generator creates password

System displays it

Optionally stores it in database via JDBC

This clear flow ensures smooth processing.


e) Database Design (Optional Feature)

A simple table is designed:

Field	Type
id	INT (Auto)
password	VARCHAR
created_at	TIMESTAMP

This keeps stored passwords managed and organized.


1. Detailed Problem Analysis

Many users create weak passwords like “12345” or “password,” which are easy to guess.

Manual password creation is time-consuming and prone to errors.

There is often no way to track or store passwords securely.

Key Requirements Identified

Passwords must be strong and unpredictable

Users should be able to choose the length

Passwords must include a mix of characters (upper/lower/digits/special)

Optional database storage for generated passwords

Program should handle invalid inputs safely

This clear understanding ensures the solution is targeted and efficient.

2. Solution Architecture in Detail

The system is designed using a layered architecture for clarity:

a) Input Layer

Handles all user inputs

Validates password length and choices

Prevents invalid inputs using exception handling

b) Processing Layer

PasswordGenerator class implements the core logic

Randomly selects characters from dynamic lists (ArrayList + Generics)

Multiple generation strategies can be applied (Strong/Medium/Custom) using polymorphism

c) Output Layer

Displays password to the user

Ensures formatting is clean and readable

Optional: Logs password in database for future use

d) Database Layer

Uses JDBC for connection

DAO classes handle insert, retrieve, update, delete operations

Ensures thread-safe operations if multiple requests are processed simultaneously

3. Algorithm Design

Create separate lists for uppercase, lowercase, digits, and special characters

Merge selected lists based on user preferences

Randomly pick characters from the merged list until required length is achieved

Return password to user and optionally save in database

Features included:

Prevents duplicate or predictable patterns

Ensures at least one character from each selected type appears

Fully dynamic and scalable

4. Object-Oriented Design Advantages

Encapsulation: Keeps password generation logic private

Inheritance: Allows creating multiple types of generators easily

Polymorphism: Enables different generation strategies with the same interface

Exception Handling: Manages invalid inputs without crashing the program

Multithreading (Optional): Can generate multiple passwords simultaneously safely

5. Data Flow Diagram (Conceptual)
[User Input] -> [Input Validation] -> [Password Generator] -> [Display Password] -> [Optional Database Storage]


Each step is modular, making the system easy to maintain and extend.

New features, such as password strength analysis or email export, can be added without rewriting existing code.

6. Benefits of this Solution

User-friendly and easy to operate

Secure and reliable passwords

Clean, modular, and maintainable architecture

Ready for future enhancements

Demonstrates professional software engineering practices


Summary

The problem is understood as a need for secure, strong passwords and an easy way for users to generate them. The solution is designed
using a modular, OOP-based structure with a strong algorithm, optional database support, and a smooth data flow.
This ensures the project is efficient, secure, and user-friendly.
