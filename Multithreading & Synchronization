Multithreading & Synchronization

In the Password Generator project, multithreading is used to perform tasks simultaneously, making the program faster and more responsive. 
Synchronization ensures that when multiple threads try to access a shared resource, the operations remain safe and consistent.




1. Multithreading

Multithreading allows the program to execute multiple tasks at the same time.
For example, while one thread is generating the password, another thread can handle validation or save the generated password in the background.

Why multithreading is used

Improves program performance

Handles multiple operations smoothly

Makes the system more efficient and responsive



2. Synchronization

When multiple threads access the same data (like the character list or password buffer), synchronization ensures that only one thread uses the shared resource at a time.

Why synchronization is important

Prevents data corruption

Avoids inconsistent or half-generated passwords

Ensures thread safety



3. How it helps the project

Password generation becomes smoother even when multiple passwords are created simultaneously

Safe handling of shared data (like character pools)

No risk of mixed or partial password outputs




Java Code Example (Multithreading & Synchronization)
class PasswordTask extends Thread {

    private PasswordGenerator generator;

    public PasswordTask(PasswordGenerator generator) {
        this.generator = generator;
    }

    @Override
    public void run() {
        synchronized (generator) {
            System.out.println("Generated by " + Thread.currentThread().getName() + ": "
                    + generator.generatePassword());
        }
    }
}

public class MultiThreadDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {

        PasswordGenerator generator = new PasswordGenerator(10);

        Thread t1 = new PasswordTask(generator);
        Thread t2 = new PasswordTask(generator);
        Thread t3 = new PasswordTask(generator);

        t1.start();
        t2.start();
        t3.start();
    }
}
