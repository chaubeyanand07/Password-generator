Classes for the Database Operations

In this project, separate classes are created to handle all the database operations. This helps in organizing the code, improving readability, 
and maintaining a clean architecture. Each class is responsible for a specific set of database tasks such as connecting to the database, inserting records,
retrieving data, updating information, and deleting entries.



1. Database Connection Class

A dedicated class is created to manage the database connection.
This class usually contains methods to:
Load the database driver
Establish a connection
Close the connection safely
This ensures that the rest of the project does not need to worry about connection details.
Why this is useful
Centralized database access
Easy to change the database in future (only one file needs update)
Clean separation of logic



2. Data Access Object (DAO) Class

DAO classes contain all the actual database operations such as:
Insert new data
Fetch stored passwords or logs
Update fields
Delete entries
Each method represents one operation, making the program modular and well-structured.
Why this is useful
All SQL queries stay in one place
Code becomes organized
Easy to debug and update database logic
Follows industry-standard architecture



3. Entity / Model Class

A model class represents the data being stored in the database.
For example, a PasswordRecord class may store:

Password
Date & time
ength
Strength level

This makes data handling easier and cleaner.

4. How These Classes Improve the Project

Database logic stays separate from UI and business logic
Makes the entire system scalable
Easy to test and update individual parts
Reduces duplication of code
Follows real-world software development architecture (MVC or layered design)



Sample Java Code for Database Operation Classes

1. Database Connection Class

import java.sql.Connection;
import java.sql.DriverManager;

public class DBConnection {

    private static final String URL = "jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/passworddb";
    private static final String USER = "root";
    private static final String PASS = "";

    public static Connection getConnection() {
        try {
            return DriverManager.getConnection(URL, USER, PASS);
        } catch (Exception e) {
            System.out.println("Database Connection Failed: " + e.getMessage());
            return null;
        }
    }
}



2. DAO Class (CRUD Operations)

import java.sql.Connection;
import java.sql.PreparedStatement;

public class PasswordDAO {

    public void savePassword(String password) {
        try {
            Connection con = DBConnection.getConnection();

            String query = "INSERT INTO passwords(password) VALUES(?)";
            PreparedStatement ps = con.prepareStatement(query);
            ps.setString(1, password);

            ps.executeUpdate();
            System.out.println("Password Saved Successfully!");

            con.close();
        } catch (Exception e) {
            System.out.println("Error Saving Password: " + e.getMessage());
        }
    }
}




3. Model Class

public class PasswordRecord {
    private String password;

    public PasswordRecord(String password) {
        this.password = password;
    }

    public String getPassword() {
        return password;
    }
}


Summary: Classes for Database Operations

In this project, all database-related work is handled through separate, well-organized classes. A dedicated Database Connection class manages the connection setup, 
making the code clean and easy to maintain. The DAO (Data Access Object) class contains all the CRUD operations such as inserting, fetching, updating, or deleting data.
A Model class represents the structure of the data stored in the database, ensuring smooth data handling.
This separation of connection, operations, and data structure keeps the project organized, improves readability, and follows real-world development practices. 
It also makes the system scalable and easy to update without affecting other parts of the project.
