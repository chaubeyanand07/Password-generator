Core Java Concepts

The Password Generator project makes full use of Core Java concepts to ensure clean, modular, and professional code. These concepts form the 
foundation of the project and help in implementing features efficiently.


1. Classes and Objects

The project is built using classes like PasswordGenerator, UserInputHandler, PasswordService, and DBHelper.
Objects of these classes are created to access methods and properties.
This allows modular design and reusability of code.



2. Methods

Each class contains methods for specific tasks, such as generatePassword(), validateInput(), and savePassword().
Methods allow encapsulation of logic and prevent code duplication.


3. Variables and Data Types

Proper use of primitive types (int, char) and reference types (String, ArrayList) is implemented.
Ensures data is stored efficiently and clearly.


4. Control Statements

Loops (for, while) are used for password generation and iterating through character lists.
Conditional statements (if-else) validate user input and enforce rules like minimum password length.

5. Exception Handling

try-catch blocks manage invalid inputs and database errors.
Ensures program does not crash and shows user-friendly messages.


6. Object-Oriented Principles

Encapsulation: Keeps password generation logic private and secure.
Inheritance: Allows creating different types of password generators (Strong, Medium, Custom).
Polymorphism: Same method generatePassword() behaves differently in different generator types.
Abstraction: Interfaces define standard methods like generatePassword() which all generators implement.

7. Collections and Generics

ArrayList and List are used to store characters.
Generics ensure type safety (List<Character>) and prevent runtime errors.
Allows dynamic handling of character sets.

8. Multithreading & Synchronization (Optional)

Threads can be used to generate multiple passwords simultaneously.
Synchronization ensures thread-safe access to shared resources like the character pool.


9. JDBC and Database Connectivity

Core Java is used to connect to databases via JDBC.
Allows inserting, retrieving, updating, and deleting password records.
Ensures data persistence for user convenience.

10. Input/Output Handling

Scanner is used for user input.
System.out is used to display generated passwords.
File I/O can also be implemented for logging if required.


import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;
import java.util.Random;
import java.util.Scanner;

class PasswordGenerator {
    private List<Character> charPool = new ArrayList<>();

    public PasswordGenerator() {
        for(char c = 'A'; c <= 'Z'; c++) charPool.add(c);
        for(char c = 'a'; c <= 'z'; c++) charPool.add(c);
        for(char c = '0'; c <= '9'; c++) charPool.add(c);
    }

    public String generatePassword(int length) {
        StringBuilder password = new StringBuilder();
        Random rand = new Random();
        for(int i=0; i<length; i++) {
            password.append(charPool.get(rand.nextInt(charPool.size())));
        }
        return password.toString();
    }
}

public class CoreJavaDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        System.out.print("Enter password length: ");
        int length = sc.nextInt();

        PasswordGenerator pg = new PasswordGenerator();
        System.out.println("Generated Password: " + pg.generatePassword(length));
    }
}



Summary

The project demonstrates full use of Core Java concepts such as classes, objects, methods, control statements, exception handling, OOP principles, collections, multithreading, JDBC, and I/O handling.
These concepts ensure that the system is efficient, secure, modular, and professional, making it a complete Java-based project.
