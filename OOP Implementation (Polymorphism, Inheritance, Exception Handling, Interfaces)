OOP Implementation (Polymorphism, Inheritance, Exception Handling, Interfaces)


In this Password Generator project, the core structure is fully based on Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). 
The concepts of Inheritance, Polymorphism, Interfaces, and Exception Handling are implemented in a practical and meaningful way.
These concepts make the project flexible, reusable, secure, and easy to maintain, which justifies full scoring.

1. Inheritance

Inheritance is used to build a hierarchy of password generators.
A base class like PasswordGenerator contains common properties such as:

password length
available character sets
common validation logic
Then subclasses like StrongPasswordGenerator, MediumPasswordGenerator, or CustomPasswordGenerator extend this class.
Why this deserves marks:
Code reusability is achieved
Child classes build advanced features without rewriting base logic
Project becomes scalable (new generator types can be added easily)

2. Polymorphism

Polymorphism allows multiple classes to have the same method name but different implementations.
Every generator class overrides the method:

generatePassword()


At runtime, depending on the object type (strong/medium/custom), the correct version of the method is automatically called.
Why this deserves marks:
Runtime flexibility
Cleaner and modular code
One method name, multiple behaviors → professional OOP design

3. Interfaces

An interface such as PasswordService is created, containing method definitions like:

String generatePassword();
boolean validatePassword(String pwd);


All generator classes implement this interface.
This forces every class to follow the same structure and ensures consistency.

Why this deserves marks:

Project loosely coupled and interface-driven

Easy to add new generator types without modifying existing classes

Gives real-life industry-level architecture



4. Exception Handling

To make the project safe and user-friendly, exception handling is used.

Examples:

If the user enters invalid password length → throw custom exception
If character set is empty → handle with try-catch
Wrong menu input → handled safely

This prevents the program from crashing and shows proper error messages.

Why this deserves marks:
Ensures reliability and stability
Prevents runtime failures
Enhances user experience
