Database Connectivity (JDBC)

JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) is used in the project to connect the Java application with the database. It allows the program to store and
retrieve data such as generated passwords, logs, or user inputs. JDBC provides the bridge between Java code and SQL queries, enabling smooth
communication with databases like MySQL, SQLite, or Oracle.


1. Loading the Driver

The database driver is responsible for enabling Java to communicate with a specific database.
The driver loads automatically in modern JDBC versions, allowing easy connection setup.


2. Establishing the Connection

A connection is created using DriverManager.getConnection(), where the database URL, username, and password are provided.
Once connected, Java can execute SQL operations through this connection.



3. Executing SQL Queries

JDBC allows executing SQL queries using:
Statement
PreparedStatement
ResultSet
PreparedStatement is preferred because it is secure, fast, and prevents SQL injection attacks.


4. Closing the Connection

After operations are completed, the connection is closed to free resources and maintain efficiency.



Sample JDBC Code (Project-Ready)

import java.sql.Connection;
import java.sql.DriverManager;
import java.sql.PreparedStatement;

public class DBConnection {

    public static Connection getConnection() {
        try {
            String url = "jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/passworddb";
            String user = "root";
            String pass = "";

            return DriverManager.getConnection(url, user, pass);

        } catch (Exception e) {
            System.out.println("Connection Failed: " + e.getMessage());
            return null;
        }
    }
}

class PasswordDAO {

    public void savePassword(String pwd) {
        try {
            Connection con = DBConnection.getConnection();

            String query = "INSERT INTO passwords(password) VALUES(?)";
            PreparedStatement ps = con.prepareStatement(query);
            ps.setString(1, pwd);

            ps.executeUpdate();
            con.close();

            System.out.println("Password Saved Successfully!");

        } catch (Exception e) {
            System.out.println("Error: " + e.getMessage());
        }
    }
}



Summary

JDBC provides the essential link between Java and the database. By establishing a connection, executing SQL queries, and safely closing resources, 
it enables smooth and secure data management within the project.
