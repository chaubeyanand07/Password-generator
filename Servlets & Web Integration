Servlets & Web Integration

Servlets are Java programs that run on a web server and handle client requests. In the Password Generator project, servlets are
used to integrate the Java backend with a web interface, allowing users to generate and manage passwords through a browser.

1. Role of Servlets

Receive requests from web clients (HTML forms)

Process business logic like password generation
Send responses back to the client dynamically
Example workflow:

User fills a web form specifying password length and type.

Servlet receives form data.

Servlet calls PasswordGenerator class to create a password.

Servlet sends generated password back to the browser for display.


2. Web Integration

HTML pages are used for user input and output display.

Forms send requests to servlets using GET or POST methods.

JSP (Java Server Pages) can optionally be used for dynamic rendering of results.

Servlets interact with JDBC to store or retrieve passwords from the database.


3. Key Features Implemented

Form Validation – Ensures correct input (length, character types).

Dynamic Response – Password is generated on the fly and displayed to the user.

Database Operations – Generated passwords can be saved or retrieved via servlets.

Modular Design – Backend logic is separated from web interface.



4. Example Servlet Code

import java.io.IOException;
import java.io.PrintWriter;
import javax.servlet.ServletException;
import javax.servlet.annotation.WebServlet;
import javax.servlet.http.*;

@WebServlet("/GeneratePassword")
public class PasswordServlet extends HttpServlet {

    protected void doPost(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response)
            throws ServletException, IOException {

        int length = Integer.parseInt(request.getParameter("length"));

        PasswordGenerator generator = new PasswordGenerator(length);
        String password = generator.generatePassword();

        // Optionally save to database
        PasswordDAO dao = new PasswordDAO();
        dao.savePassword(password);

        response.setContentType("text/html");
        PrintWriter out = response.getWriter();
        out.println("<h2>Your Generated Password: " + password + "</h2>");
    }
}


5. How Web Integration Helps

Users can access the password generator from any browser, making it platform-independent.

Easy to create user-friendly interfaces using HTML/CSS.

Backend logic (Java classes) and frontend (HTML/JSP) are separated, making the system modular.

Allows integration with database for persistence of generated passwords.


6. Summary

Servlets & Web Integration bridge the Java backend and the web frontend, enabling users to generate, display, and store passwords through a browser interface.
It demonstrates the project’s capability to work in a web-based environment, combining core Java, JDBC, and web technologies.
